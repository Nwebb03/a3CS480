## Compile Instructions
- Run `make` in the project directory to build the program.
- Generates an executable named `sim`.
- Run `make clean` to remove objects and the executable.

---

## Operating Instructions
- Run `./sim`.
- No command-line arguments.
- The program simulates 10,000 requests and prints final statistics for First Fit and Best Fit.
- A CSV `results.csv` is also produced for graphing.

---

## Background
- Memory size: 256 KB divided into 2 KB units → 128 units total.
- Requests: processes request 3–10 units.
- Techniques: First Fit and Best Fit managed via a linked-list of `memoryBlock`s with coalescing.
- API per spec: `allocate_mem`, `deallocate_mem`, `fragment_count`.
- Per assignment rule, each process ID is allocated at most once overall.

---

## Simulation Setup and Parameters
- Requests: 10,000.
- Process IDs: up to 10,000 unique PIDs; each used at most once.
- Allocation requests include a number of units uniformly distributed in [3,10].
- `fragment_count` counts holes of size 1 or 2 units after coalescing.
- Metrics collected for each technique:
  - Average external fragments per request.
  - Average nodes traversed per allocation.
  - Percentage of allocation requests denied.

---

## Findings (example: your run will vary)
- End of First Fit Allocation
  - Average External Fragments Each Request: ~3.1
  - Average Nodes Transversed Each Allocation: ~6.6
  - Percentage Allocation Requests Denied Overall: ~43%
- End of Best Fit Allocation
  - Average External Fragments Each Request: ~3.3
  - Average Nodes Transversed Each Allocation: ~12.6
  - Percentage Allocation Requests Denied Overall: ~43%

Interpretation:
- Best Fit tends to traverse more nodes per allocation than First Fit.
- Fragmentation behavior depends on request patterns. In the shown run, First Fit had slightly fewer fragments on average.
- High denial rates indicate memory pressure with the chosen parameters.

---

## Lessons Learned
- Linked-list memory management with coalescing is sensitive to allocation patterns.
- Best Fit can increase traversal cost while not always reducing fragmentation.
- Accurate stats require careful definitions (per-allocation vs per-request).
